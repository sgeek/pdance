Data entry stuff (before next comp):
--
(purely about data entry - neater, and not requiring phpMyAdmin)
- Implement comp_event and comp_level (nice-to-have only)
- Implement comp_dancer (nice-to-have only)
- Proper management for all background data:
	- city
	- comp (also handles comp_event and comp_level)
	- dancer
	- event
	- level
	- performance_type
	- round
	- school

Auth stuff (obsolete, just using single admin password instead):
--
(purely about securing pDance so that the management interface is safe to be public)
- Implement authentication
	- User table
		- id
		- email
		- name
		- password (hash)
		- verifed (timestamp)
		- session
	- "Add user" page
		- Accessible to all users; all known users assumed admin for now
		- If users table empty, accessible to anyone
		- Send email, rely on email verification
			- Set session field on account creation, use that session ID as a safe email verification code
	- Password reset
		- Require email and name (so eg. "user@name.com" and "User Name"
		- Set session hash, send email using session hash as verification code
		- On nav to reset page with correct session hash provided:
			- Set new session hash, embed as hidden field in password reset form
			- Take password (and duplicate for confirmation)
			- On form submit:
				- Confirm that password1 and password2 match
				- Clear session field
				- Write password hash to password field
				- Set verified field to current timestamp
